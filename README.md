Freelance work done for IACR

Creating a program for a conference is a complicated task. My aim with this project is to make a GUI for conference program creation. This will be an internal tool for IACR members.

The only dependencies are websubrev and to produce output for [conference template](https://github.com/kaymckelly/freelance-iacr).

Note that PDF printing requires that mpdf and twig be installed via composer.
