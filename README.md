# program-editor
This is a GUI for conference program creation and editing. It is an internal tool for IACR members.

The only dependencies are websubrev and to produce output for the schema required by the [conference template](https://github.com/IACR/conference-template).

Note that PDF printing requires that mpdf and twig be installed via composer.
